# Hotspot Helper
Fixes the lag spikes caused by windows hotspot when using wireless Virtual Reality streaming apps.

## Features
- Fixes the lag spikes caused by Windows Hotspot scanning
- Minimal setup
- Starts the hotspot and applies the fix

## Instructions
Setup the windows hotspot first, just simply go to the hotspot settings, and configure the SSID/Password. Make sure to set the band to 5ghz, or you'll have a pretty crappy time. If it is your first time running the script, a first-time setup portion will list and ask you to select the wifi interface that will be used to create the hotspot. It will then bring you into the main menu, where you can do one of 5 things: [1] Turn on hotspot with fix - [2] Restore AutoConfig - [3] Change Wireless Interface - [4] Exit - [5] Uninstall
